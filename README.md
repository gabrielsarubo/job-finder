# job-finder-api

API for a job listings platform.

This project was developed as part of the course "Aprenda tudo sobre JavaScript" by Matheus Battisti. The project was originally made to work as a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) by using Handlebars, but I adapdted it to only work as an API, removing the need to use Handlebars altogether.
