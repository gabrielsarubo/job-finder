# job-finder-api

API for a job listings platform.

This project was developed as part of the course "Aprenda tudo sobre JavaScript" by Matheus Battisti. The project was originally made to work as a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) by using Handlebars, but I adapdted it to only work as an API, removing the need to use Handlebars altogether.

This project was developed using Node.js with Express and SQLite as its database.

DB Browser for SQLite was used to create, search, and edit SQLite database files.

## Installation

In order to run the project in your machine, clone this repo and run the following commands in the terminal:

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> For now, in order to persist data and successfully run the API locally, you need the `app.db` database file that can be found here.
> After downloading it, move the file to `./db`

```
git clone https://github.com/gabrielsarubo/job-finder-api.git

cd job-finder-api

npm install

npm run dev
```
